                        #1
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        How can we describe a person?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Appearance, body shape, tone of voice. All well and good, but there seems to be more to it than
                        that.<br>
                        What is a human being except the parts that can be seen or felt?
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div id="desc-1-4">
                    <h2>
                        #2
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        I see people as stories, stories that are connected to each other and build up our souls.<br>
                        An event or a conversation can make a person understand behavior, a personality more than words.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As you can see, I am an ordinary person with passion for painting and music, but I believe there
                        is something else you feel from these pictures, they are not simply facts?
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div id="desc-1-3">
                    <h2>
                        #3
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        I owned a piano before I was four, and my dad gave it to me as a gift for my birthday.<br>
                        It was always carefully placed in the most prominent corner of the living room, no matter where
                        we moved.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div id="desc-1-2">
                    <h2>
                        #4
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        Mr. Sun was my second piano teacher. I went to visit him regularly to take his lessons until I
                        went to college in another province.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To dress the piano beautifully, my mother decorated it with two different covers, dust-proof
                        mats and various ornaments, and even the back wall could not be left empty.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div id="desc-1-1">
                    <h2>
                        #5
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        Practice, of course, is never easy, and as with any other type of pressure, the practice time
                        can be extremely long, boring and endless.<br>
                        My evasion and absent-mindedness were clear to Sun, who reported to my mother that I was
                        chronically behind in my schedule, thus having the most intense quarrel between my mother and
                        me.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "If that’s what you want, to stop, I will have the piano smashed tomorrow."<br>
                        She left the words and stormed out of room.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I had to ask my mother for forgiveness the next day, and for the first time I was acutely aware
                        that I was tied to something I couldn't let go.
                    </p>

                    <h2>
                        #1
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        You may be wondering, what do these stories mean?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This question has also trapped me for a long time, why do people always use stories of their
                        life to illustrate who they are? Many objects don't have any special meaning to anybody else. It
                        seems that my memories and feelings can't exist without me, right?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I'm not a metaphysician, but a person's existence may really be a belief, a belief in being
                        alive, a belief in the existence of others, a belief in one's own existence. When we lose it, we
                        cease to exist.
                    </p>

                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        Before the summer vacation of 2013, I received a call from my mother telling me that Sun had
                        passed away due to this stomach cancer he had had for years.<br>
                        I was stunned, trying to remember all the things he had said and done with me when he was still
                        teaching me with his piano. What made me feel so hurt?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It kept reminding me of the way he smiled. He seemed to be happy every day.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div id="desc-2-3">
                    <h2>
                        #3
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        I have never had a photo taken with Sun. My mother felt sorry. "It's a shame that we felt too
                        close to have one."<br>
                        I agree, we always take things for granted.

                        In fact, we couldn't find his handwriting, or even a simple object that he had given me.

                        When I think of Sun, I think of the European desk clock on our piano. I think of my father
                        copying part of Sun's home decoration style, a very baroque style with warm colors.

                        I can visualise our annual joint performance on the stage, and thought that I did not get the
                        top three in the competition, I was not his best student.<br>
                        I can still remember him inviting me to stay for lunch, and how he told me he couldn't finish
                        his meal because he'd had half his stomach removed in surgery.

                        His favorite piece was Coral Dance, he adored Richard Clayderman, and he wanted me to listen to
                        something he'd just improved.

                        It took me years to realize that my mother was closer to Sun than I thought, so I asked her
                        about him, something I could never know as a student of his.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In her eyes, Sun was the same as I had imagined him, chilling and joking around, often taking my
                        mother to the lesser-known local garage sale in a tracksuit, and even when invited to play at my
                        father's coffee shop, he wore plain casual clothes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It was like finding a $20 bill in an old jacket and feeling like I was living again in it.
